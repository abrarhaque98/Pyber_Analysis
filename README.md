# Pyber_Analysis

### Overview of the Analysis
The objective of this analysis was to analyze and visualize ride sharing data from 2019 for the company Pyber with the use of matplotlib and pandas. The new analysis (challenge) 
was to create a multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The city types consisted of three city types, Urban, Suburban, and Rural. 


### Results

Above shows the Pyber Summary with city types as indexes. When the data was sorted the three various city types had very different volumes and average numbers. The total amount of rides from rural to suburban and urban change dramatically as well as the total drivers. The urban city index had a 13:1 total ride ratio compared to rural where as suburban had a 5:1 ratio. The average fare per ride and per driver also trended down as the data moved city types from Rural to Suburban to Urban. The urban city type's yielded the largest fare revenue.

Above displays the visualization of Weekly Fare's by City type on a line graph trending their revenue from the months of January to April. This allows the end user to visualize how much revenue was driven in on a weekly basis throughout these months and in which type of city. 

### Summary
From the visualizations certain assumptions can be made to address the disparities. 

* The urban cities were able to generate significantly more revenue than the other city types, this may be because of the significant supply of drivers and ability to constantly fulfill ride sharing requests. This also brings down the average fare per ride because of the competition amongst other drivers.
* The disparity in total rides may be because of lesser demand in rural areas. Rural cities have lesser populations than urban cities, a cross referencing of the total ride data should be done with average population data of the city types. Along with that a percentage of rural city car owners should be compared to that of other city types. 
* If the demand for ride sharing exists in the less revenue generating city types then it provides an opportunity to expand into those city types.
